# dynamol

This code base has not been maintained in a number of years.  
The code requires QT 3?  I believe to be compiled.
It will also require the Boost C++ libraries which are used to both extend functionality to python as well as embedding the pythogn interpretor for command line scripting.

Yes I really need to bring this project back to life.. and to be fair open sourcing it was the first step in that direction.
