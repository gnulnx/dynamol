To use the buildDist program folow these istructions

1) Make sure the installer binary is present
2) Make sure a LIBS directory is present
   --This directory contains all the potential dynamoic linking libraries that will be needed
3) Make sure the initScript file is present
4) Make sure the break file is present
5) Make sure the dynamol.tar.gz file is present
    --This file is the directory structre for the install.  
    --This file is build in the DYNAMOL/build directory


The basic steps work as follows
make your directory structure in the DYNAMOL_x_XX/build directory. 

tar -cf dynamol.tar dynamol/
gzip dynamol.tar

cp dynamol.tar.gz ../installer/bin

cd ../install/bin

./buildDist

then test that it works like
cp dynamol-install test
cd test
chmod +x dynamol-install
su root
./dynamol-install


Add any extra dynamic libraries that you think your users might need to the LIBS directory
